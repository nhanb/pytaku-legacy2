Manga fetcher for otaku on the go

This project is currently in an unstable stage and under active development. Full documentation
will be provided when all the scaffolding has been finalized.

## Development environment setup

To make your life easier, make sure your `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable includes:

- Path to Google App Engine SDK on your computer
- Path to your project root

All code submitted here should pass the latest version of `flake8` check without any warning.
That's why I included `flake8` in **requiements.txt**.
